= Karaf CXF Image

This is an example Apache Karaf and CXF image w/ a simple hello world REST application

Great getting started example here: https://github.com/mkroli/karaf-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile

Start container example:

----
docker run -d -t mkwyche/karaf-cxf:1.0 -p 8181:8081
----

Once the container is up and running you'll be able to see an example REST endpoint at http://[docker machine ip]:8181/cxf/hello . To pass in a 
parameter hit this endpoint http:[docker machine ip]:8181/cxf/hello/[param] . 

At startup I deploy CXF and the REST bundle so it takes maybe 10-30 seconds for all the deps to get installed. In order to see the status of your container you can 
run the tail command mentioned below. 

Accessing running container

----
docker exec -i -t [container ID] /bin/bash
----

Tail karaf logs

----
docker exec -i -t [container ID] tail -f apache-karaf/data/karaf.log
