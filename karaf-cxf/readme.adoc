= Karaf CXF Image

This is an example Apache Karaf and CXF image w/ a simple hello world REST application

Great getting started example here: https://github.com/mkroli/karaf-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile

Start container example:

----
docker run -d -t datadidit/karaf-cxf -p 8181:8081
----

Once the container is up and running you'll be able to to interact with the following REST endpoints:
* http://[docker machine ip]:8181/cxf/hello . To pass in a 
* http:[docker machine ip]:8181/cxf/hello/[param] . 

At startup I deploy CXF and the REST bundle so it takes maybe ~30 seconds for all the deps to get installed into the karaf container. In order to see the status of your container you can 
run the tail command mentioned below. 

Accessing running container

----
docker exec -i -t [container ID] /bin/bash
----

Tail karaf logs

----
docker exec -i -t [container ID] tail -f apache-karaf/data/karaf.log
